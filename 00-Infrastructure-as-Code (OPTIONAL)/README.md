# 📦 Lakehouse Infrastructure – Deployment with Terraform

This repository contains the full automation of the infrastructure for a Lakehouse-type project on Azure. Deployment is based on Terraform, with a Python post-deployment script to finalize the Databricks workspace setup and import notebooks.

## Features

- Creation of dedicated resource groups for SQL and Databricks
- Deployment of a SQL Server with AdventureWorksLT database (student format)
- Creation of an Azure Key Vault containing SQL credentials
- Provisioning of an Azure Databricks Workspace with a managed resource group
- Generation of reusable Terraform outputs for scripts
- Versioned storage of `.py` notebooks in the `/notebooks/` folder:
  - `01_Init.py`
  - `12_ETL_Bronze_PyPsark.py`
  - `22_ETL_Silver_PySpark.py`
  - `23_Testing_SCD2.py`
  - `33_ETL_Gold_Dim_PySpark.py`
  - `34_ETL_Gold_Fact_PySpark.py`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geraldherrera/tb-lakehouse-enhanced.git
cd infra-azure-lakehouse
```

### 2. Prepare Configuration Files

> ⚠️ The Databricks workspace name **must always start with `dbw-`**, otherwise there will be issues with notebook paths in Databricks.

Update the following files:

- `secrets.auto.tfvars`
```hcl
subscription_id     = "<your-subscription-id>"
sql_admin           = "<sql-username>"
sql_password        = "<sql-password>"
aad_admin_login     = "<your-email@domain.com>"
aad_admin_object_id = "<your-user-object-id>"
```

- `terraform.tfvars`
```hcl
location                    = "westeurope"
location_sql                = "switzerlandnorth"
rg_datasource_name          = "rg-datasource-dev-ghe"
rg_dataplatform_name        = "rg-dataplatform-dev-ghe"
sql_server_name             = "sql-datasource-dev-ghe"
sql_database_name           = "sqldb-adventureworks-dev-ghe"
key_vault_name              = "kv-jdbc-secrets-dev-ghe"
databricks_workspace_name   = "dbw-dataplatform-dev-ghe"
databricks_managed_rg_name  = "mg-dataplatform-dev-ghe"
```

### 3. Initialize and Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```
Press `yes` when prompted.

### 4. Configure Azure SQL Access

Go to Azure Portal:
- Open the SQL Server
- Go to **Security** tab
- Add your IP address to the firewall rules
- Allow Azure services to access the SQL Server

### 5. Modify Notebooks with Deployment Outputs

After infrastructure deployment, retrieve required values (hostname, database name, workspace name) from Terraform outputs or the Azure portal.

Update the following notebook:

- `22_ETL_Bronze_PySpark.py` → `jdbc_hostname` and `jdbc_database`
- `finalize_databricks_deployment.py` → `DATABRICKS_NOTEBOOK_FOLDER`

### 6. Prepare Finalization Script

Edit the `finalize_databricks_deployment.py` script to set:

- `DATABRICKS_NOTEBOOK_FOLDER` #this is mandatory or the script will fail to import the notebooks
- `CLUSTER_NAME`
- `POLICY_NAME`
- `DATABRICKS_WORKFLOW_NAME`
- `JOB_TASK_BRONZE_NAME`
- `JOB_TASK_SILVER_NAME`
- `JOB_TASK_GOLD_NAME`

### 7. Generate Databricks Token

In the Databricks UI:
- Go to **User Settings > Developer**
- Create a **Personal Access Token**

### 8. Run Finalization Script

```bash
python finalize_databricks_deployment.py
```

> ⚠️ You will be prompted to enter your Databricks personal access token.

### 9. Wait for Initialization to Complete

The script will:
- Import notebooks
- Start the cluster
- Execute the initialization notebook

> ⏳ This may take several minutes due to cluster startup time.

### 10. Monitor Pipeline Execution

The script launches the ETL pipeline. You can follow execution in the Databricks interface under **Jobs > <your job name>**.


## ETL Orchestration in Databricks (Workflow)

Once infrastructure is deployed and notebooks are imported, a Databricks workflow is automatically created by the `finalize_databricks_deployment.py` script.

By default this workflow is called **`lakehouse_etl_pipeline-ghe`**. It follows a three-layer architecture with the following tasks:

```
| Task                 | Notebook Path                                                        | Dependency          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `task_bronze_ghe`    | `/Workspace/Users/<your-email@domain.com>/12_ETL_Bronze_PyPsark`     | None                |
| `task_silver_ghe`    | `/Workspace/Users/<your-email@domain.com>/22_ETL_Silver_PySpark.py`  | `task_bronze_ghe`   |
| `task_gold_dim_ghe`  | `/Workspace/Users/<your-email@domain.com>/33_ETL_Gold_Dim_PySpark.py`| `task_silver_ghe`   |
| `task_gold_fact_ghe` | `/Workspace/Users/<your-email@domain.com>/33_ETL_Gold_Dim_PySpark.py`| `task_gold_dim_ghe` |
```

Each task runs on the personal cluster preconfigured by the script.

> This workflow ensures consistent execution of the data pipeline from bronze to gold layers.

## Power BI Access via Serverless Warehouse

The `finalize_databricks_deployment.py` script also creates a Serverless SQL Warehouse named "Serverless SQL". It is automatically configured with the following settings:

```
Type : Serverless

Size : 2X-Small (XXS)

Auto Stop : 10 minutes

Min/Max Clusters : 1

Channel : Current
```

This warehouse can be used immediately from Power BI as a direct data source with no further setup.

To connect, use the Databricks connector in Power BI and select the "Serverless SQL" warehouse.

## Power BI Dashboard

The `dashboard_example.pbix` file is an interactive Power BI sample dashboard designed to demonstrate data consumption from the star schema built from Gold layer data in Databricks.

This file is designed to connect directly to the automatically deployed "Serverless SQL" warehouse. Just add it as a data source.

## Notes

- If at least the `secrets.auto.tfvars` file is properly filled and the `DATABRICKS_NOTEBOOK_FOLDER` var is properly updated (in finalize_databricks_deployment.py), the entire process should work **without any additional manual modifications**.
